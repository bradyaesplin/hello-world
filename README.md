# Hello! 
My name is Brady A. Esplin, I am currently a student at Western Oregon University on term 2 out of 7(ish) of a **B.S. Information Systems (Focus: Cypbersecurity)**. I completed my **A. S. Networking and Systems Administration** at Linn-Benton Community College in 9/2021. 

My intent for this github account is that it will be the main repository to show all of the schoolwork that I have saved, and to save all of my personal projects. Going forward I will use this account as the main version control method for personal projects.
