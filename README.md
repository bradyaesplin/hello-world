following github tutorial for a memory refresh

# Hello! 
My name is Brady A. Esplin, I am currently a student at Western Oregon University on term 2 out of 7(ish) of a **B.S. Information Systems (Focus: Cypbersecurity)**. I completed my **A. S. Networking and Systems Administration** at Linn-Benton Community College in 9/2021. 

My intent for this github account is that it will be the main repository to show all of the schoolwork that I have saved, and to save all of my personal projects. Going forward I will use this account as the main version control method for personal projects.

Below is a copy of the OSI-TCP/IP Model that I made because there were not any that looked decent enough to hang on my wall for reference. I have uploaded a .xml file that you may open at draw.io to print the image. Please feel free to use as you would like, I retain no rights to the chart.
